# Twilio CodeExchange

The [Twilio CodeExchange](https://twilio.com/code-exchange) is a cental hub for developers to find template applications that get them started on solving particular use cases. You can find all templates by visiting [twilio.com/code-exchange](https://www.twilio.com/code-exchange).

This repository serves a place for you to:
1. File bugs with respect to either template applications or the general website
2. Request new templates for use cases 
3. Submit a request to have a template you built to be added to the Code Exchange
4. Learn about the [coding guidelines](guidelines/) for the respective template applications
5. Give general feedback

## Contributing

All templates on the CodeExchange welcome contributions. In order to contribute to one, please head over to the project for the respective template and check out their `README.md` and `CONTRIBUTING.md` to learn how to get started.

If you want to contribute your own template application, please read the [guidelines](guidelines/) for your respective programming language and build your application in accordance to those. 

Afterwards [create an issue](https://github.com/twilio-labs/code-exchange/issues/new/choose) in this project to submit a request for submission of a template. We'll then review your application and see if we can add it to the Code Exchange.
